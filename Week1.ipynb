        "Hi! Welcome to Week 1! I'm Nasha, your AI Coach at Halls of Learning. I will be posting weekly notebooks to recap what we have covered, and offer additional resources if anyone needs support, or assistance catching up. This week we spoke a bit about the competition that our AI training program is aligned with: the International Olympiad in Artificial Intelligence. From the full syllabus, we will be focusing on the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   Week 1 - 2: Python Programming and Data Handling Foundations\n",
        "*   Week 3 - 4:  Machine Learning Foundations; Supervised Learning\n",
        "*   Week 5 - 6: Model Evaluation and Tuning; Unsupervised Learning\n",
        "*   Week 7 - 8: Neural Netowrks, Deep Learning\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This week, we mostly did introductory tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "We created Github accounts, and subscribed to HallsofLearningCoding. We also found out that we will need access to an IDE, or an Integrated Development Environment every class so that we can program. I recommend using\n",
        "*  https://colab.research.google.com/ If you would like to get started quickly and focus on learning necessary theory and code\n",
        "*  Visual Studio Code, or another IDE that can be used locally, or on your machine instead of in your browser. Only choose this option if you are comfortable installing any necessary libraries/frameworks.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "We also attempted a python quiz, which I have included below with possible solutions. If you ranked this quiz at medium or hard I **strongly** recommend looking into this resource:\n",
